	// Watch out for this! Make sure that the data is available before enabling auto-save for expanded items. You can switch it on within the nib. Problem though is that the data store must be available at nib awaking time! Otherwise, how can the auto-saving of expanded items compare against existing items in order to determine whether or not they should be restored as expanded or not.
	// There's another caveat. You need to let the bindings make the necessary connections first, before connecting the Core Data context and persistent store coordinator to the store. In other words, the store must be added last. Here is a good place. Application-did-finish-launching occurs after all nib awaking methods, after bindings have been established. Hence, when the store gets added, the outline view immediately sees the contents through its bindings. Otherwise the outline-view expanded items auto-saver cannot see the items at all.
